@MethodAnnotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view. 
Supported for controller classes with @RequestMapping methods.


Eg: binding method paramter to model attribute msg
@RequestMapping("/")
   public String intiView(@ModelAttribute("countries") List<String> countries,
         @ModelAttribute("cities") List<String> cities,
         @ModelAttribute("languages") List<String> languages,
         Model model) {
      //code...along with msg, countries, cities and languages sent to main.jsp
      model.addAttribute("msg", "This is an example of using @ModelAttribute.....");
      
      return "main";
   }


Eg : binding return value to model attribute, india,usa , japan assigned to countries model attribute
@ModelAttribute("countries")
   public List<String> populateCountries() {
      List<String> countries= new ArrayList<>();
      countries.add("India");
      countries.add("USA");
      countries.add("Japan");
      return countries;
   }

Can be used to expose command objects to a web view, using specific attribute names, 
through annotating corresponding parameters of an @RequestMapping method.

Can also be used to expose reference data to a web view through annotating accessor methods 
in a controller class with @RequestMapping methods. Such accessor methods are allowed to have any arguments that @RequestMapping methods support, 
returning the model attribute value to expose.

Note however that reference data and all other model content is not available to web views when request processing results in an Exception since the exception could be raised at any time making the content of the model unreliable.
For this reason @ExceptionHandler methods do not provide access to a Model argument.
