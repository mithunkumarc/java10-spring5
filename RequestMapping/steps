The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map the web request onto a handler class (i.e. Controller) or a handler method

The value attribute of the @RequetMapping annotation is used to map the handler method to a path and it can be written as   @GetMapping(value="/one") , which is equivalent to @GetMapping("/one").

Spring also provides five method-level composed variant of the @RequestMapping annotation -

    @GetMapping → equivalent to @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET).
    @PostMapping → equivalent to @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST).
    @PutMapping → equivalent to @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT).
    @DeleteMapping → equivalent to @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE).
    @PatchMapping → equivalent to @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PATCH).
